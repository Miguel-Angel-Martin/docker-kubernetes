Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!

Create two Dockerfile with the base images and commands.


2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.

docker build -t node_assigment_02:1.0 .

docker build -t python_assigment_02:1.0 .


3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.



4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.

5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.

6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.

docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --rm --name node_assigment node_assigment_02:1.0

Python is a console app

docker run  -it --rm --name python_assigment python_assigment_02:1.0
